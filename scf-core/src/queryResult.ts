/**
 * queryResult.ts — the canonical queries' normative answers. Spec §12.
 *
 * The sixteen canonical queries are part of the format: they are the
 * questions SCF exists to answer, and shipping them is the guidance the
 * format is for. What is normative is the RESULT STRUCTURE, not any
 * rendering of it — markdown is a convenience, and an implementation
 * that produces the right answer in a different presentation is
 * conforming.
 *
 * This module lives in scf-core rather than beside the runners in the
 * app for that reason. The app renders; the core answers.
 *
 * THREE RULES MAKE A RESULT PORTABLE, and all three exist because an
 * independent implementation tripped over their absence:
 *
 *   Rows are referenced by `uuid`, never by row id. Row ids are local to
 *   a file (§6.2) and a writer may renumber them; a uuid survives export
 *   and re-import (§6.1). An expectation carrying `character #1` — as
 *   one blessed artifact did — is pinned to one file's accidents.
 *
 *   Volatile and framework columns are dropped: `id`, `created_at`,
 *   `updated_at`. They differ between two files that say the same thing,
 *   so including them would fail a comparison for reasons unrelated to
 *   correctness.
 *
 *   Reference columns are RESOLVED to uuids: `scene_id` becomes
 *   `scene_uuid`. A result that carried the number would be describing
 *   the file rather than the story.
 *
 * Field names are the registry's own column names. A result is made of
 * registry fields, so inventing a second vocabulary for them would
 * create exactly the drift this format keeps designing against.

 * defect this module exists to prevent.
 *
 * A column the REGISTRY declares polymorphic — a reference whose target
 * table is chosen per row by a sibling column — is dropped too, marked
 * in the reference map by `POLYMORPHIC`. The query lifts the resolved
 * target alongside the projected row (§12.11).
 *
 * THIS USED TO DROP EVERY COLUMN ENDING `_id` that carried no
 * reference, which is a different and much larger set. It deleted
 * `external_id` — a declared, authored field on ten entities — and
 * `clip.screenplay_line_start_id` and `_end_id`, which are ordinary
 * references whose target is a screenplay table rather than a registry
 * entity. Twelve legitimate columns, gone from every projected row.
 *
 * No artifact could catch it. The fixture authors no `external_id` and
 * its `clip` table is empty, and §12.1.2 omits empty fields, so a
 * correct implementation and a data-losing one produce byte-identical
 * output on all sixteen published results. It took a reader
