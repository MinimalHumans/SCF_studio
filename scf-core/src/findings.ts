/**
 * findings.ts — the finding vocabulary. Spec §9.5.
 *
 * SCF describes and does not enforce (§9.1), so every problem in a file
 * is a FINDING: reported, never a reason to refuse the data.
 *
 * Six modules produce findings, each with its own richly-typed result,
 * because the panels that consume them need the detail. This module does
 * not replace them. It adds a NORMAL FORM — one shape, one code space,
 * one severity scale — that every producer projects into and that a
 * third party can depend on. A validator whose output cannot be compared
 * between two runs, let alone two implementations, is a demonstration
 * rather than a tool.
 *
 * Three properties are deliberate:
 *
 *   Codes are dotted strings, not numbers. `identity.uuid_missing` needs
 *   no central registry to allocate and says what it is when it turns up
 *   in someone's log. A numeric code would need a table to be readable
 *   and would eventually be reused wrongly.
 *
 *   Codes are a closed union. Adding one is a deliberate act with a
 *   catalog entry naming the spec section it comes from, so a finding
 *   can never be raised that the specification does not describe.
 *
 *   Severity is about the DATA, never about acceptance. `error` means
 *   two conforming readers would disagree about what the file says. It
 *   does not mean refuse the file, and nothing in SCF ever does.
