 * resolution.ts — SCF resolution semantics, executable.

 *
 * Implements the walks the canonical queries are built from:
 *   - the DESCRIPTION cascade: profile -> states-in-force -> beats, per
 *     modality, with the 2.1 persistence semantics and key-wise modulation
 *     stacking
 *   - the DIRECTION cascade: registry `refines` graph walked root-first,
 *     most specific last (Q07 / Q08 / Q11)
 *   - the MEDIA cascade: bundle -> binding -> anchor -> shot override ->
 *     assets (Q13)
 *   - location-variant selection for a scene (resolver-first)
 *
 * Conventions honoured throughout:
 *   - story position order is derived from the SCRIPT (spec §4.1), via
 *     sceneOrder() below — never from scene_number alone
 *   - most-specific-wins; everything above the winner is returned as
 *     context, ordered root-first
 *   - absence is well-defined: a missing layer is skipped, never an error
 *
 * pyTruthy() treats null, undefined, "", 0 and false as absent in the
 * predicates that need it. The conformance fixture pins those edge
 * values, so the behaviour cannot be relaxed silently.
