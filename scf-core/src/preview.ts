 * preview.ts — what can actually be shown (P5).

 * Three tiers, and the third is a real tier rather than a failure.
 * Three of the eight assets in the Hollow Creek fixture are in it, and
 * an asset browser that treats "cannot preview" as an error state would
 * be wrong about nearly half a real project.
 *
 *   native   — the browser decodes it. An <img>, <video> or <audio>
 *              element and an object URL, nothing more.
 *   decoded  — real content that needs a decoder SCF does not ship
 *              (exr, tiff, glb, mov). Named so the UI can say "not
 *              yet" rather than "no", and so the work is scoped when
 *              somebody wants it.
 *   named    — nothing to depict. Archives, caches, model weights.
 *              A LoRA is not media: you do not look at it, you invoke
 *              it, and there is no image of it to fail to render.
 *
 * Sidecar thumbnails are ruled out by the read-only rule (conventions
 * §9): something would have to write them, and it will not be SCF.
 * Tier 2 therefore means an in-memory decoder or nothing.
 *
 * Format is derived from the identifier and is only ever a hint about
 * BYTES. It says nothing about purpose — that lives on the link.
