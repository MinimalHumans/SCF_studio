/**
 * mediaReferences.ts — what a query says about the assets it reaches (P6).
 *
 * The rule (conventions §9): a query never returns bytes. Q13 already
 * returned asset ROWS, which was close but not the same thing — a row
 * is whatever columns the table happens to have, and a consumer reading
 * one has to know the schema to find the address. What travels instead
 * is a reference: identifier, format, the role it plays, the intent it
 * was resolved under, where in the cascade it came from, and whether
 * anything is actually there.
 *
 * The second half is the report. An export that silently omits three
 * unresolvable references is worse than one that admits it, and this is
 * the same principle §2 applies everywhere else: derivations stay total
 * and report findings rather than throwing.
 *
 * The locator is injected, so a report can be produced with no
 * filesystem at all — which is the normal case for a session opened
 * without a project folder, and the case every test here uses.
