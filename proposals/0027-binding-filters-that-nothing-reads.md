# 0027 — Binding filters that nothing reads

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | **implemented** — spec 0.56, schema 2.16 |
| **Author** | Found by the first `scf-mcp` session, writing a prompt for shot 3B; written up by the maintainers |
| **Opened** | 2026-09-28 |
| **Affects** | Spec §12.8; six columns on the three `*_asset_binding` entities; `stability.md`'s media row; the fixture. Overlaps [0012](0012-time-of-day.md) (`time_of_day_filter`'s vocabulary) and [0025](0025-json-that-duplicates-or-means-nothing.md) (`conditions_json`) |

## The problem

**The three binding entities declare six columns that narrow when a
binding applies. The media cascade reads one of them.**

| Column | On | Read by §12.8? |
|---|---|---|
| `scene_range_start_id` / `scene_range_end_id` | all three | **yes** |
| `variant_id` | all three | no |
| `act_id` | all three | no |
| `time_of_day_filter` | `location_asset_binding` | no |
| `physical_state_filter` / `vocal_state_filter` | `character_asset_binding` | no |
| `conditions_json` | all three | no |

`bindingApplies` (spec §12.8, `resolution.ts`) tests the scene range and
nothing else. So a binding scoped to a variant, an act, a time of day or
a physical state **applies everywhere** — the opposite of what its
author wrote, and silently: the resolution `trail` shows the binding
firing, with no note that four of its five conditions were never
evaluated.

Nothing in the repository catches this. The fixture authors none of the
six columns, so every artifact is byte-identical whether an
implementation honours them or ignores them — the same invisible class
as `external_id` before 0.40 and the empty `asset_relationship` table
before 2.13. A second implementation reading the registry would honour
them, diverge from the published results on a file that used them, and
be right.

This bit in practice. Asked for the wind chime's media at scene 3, the
file returned its scene 24 state, because the way to express "only after
scene 24" that the resolver reads is the scene range, and the columns
that look like they mean that do not. The fixture now uses the range —
which is the workaround, not the answer.

## The proposal

**Every declared filter is either read by §12.8 or removed.** The
recommendation, per column:

1. **`variant_id` — specify on `location_asset_binding`, remove on the
   other two.** §12.17 already scores `location_variant` against a
   scene on three axes and reports `mismatches`, so a binding naming a
   location variant applies where that variant is the one in force and
   nowhere else — the column with a definition already written, which
   only had to be pointed at.

   **Character and prop variants have no such rule.** Nothing in the
   format says which `character_variant` or `prop_variant` is in force
   at a position: there is no positional pattern on either, and no
   junction names one. A filter that cannot be evaluated is the defect
   this proposal is about, so those two columns go. If a rule arrives —
   a `scene_prop.variant_id`, say — the filter comes back with it.
2. **`time_of_day_filter` — specify**, on 0012's vocabulary: the
   binding applies where the scene's `time_of_day` equals it, compared
   trimmed and case-insensitively. Without 0012 it is free text matched
   against free text, which is why the two proposals should land
   together.
3. **`physical_state_filter` / `vocal_state_filter` — specify.** A state
   filter applies where a `performance_state` of that modality is in
   force at the position (§4.5) and its **name** matches, compared
   trimmed and case-insensitively. The name and not the description: a
   filter is something an author types, and nobody retypes "Thrown at
   the crossing; guarding her left side, dragging step." This is the
   "Eleanor guards her left side after scene 9" case, which today lives
   in prose inside a field value.
4. **`act_id` — remove.** Act membership is derived from boundaries
   (§5.1), so an act-scoped binding is a scene range written in a way
   that goes stale when a boundary moves. Anything it can say, the range
   says better.
5. **`conditions_json` — remove**, as [0025](0025-json-that-duplicates-or-means-nothing.md)
   already proposes. (It went in schema 2.15, before this proposal
   landed, so 2.16 had five columns to deal with rather than six.)

And, whatever is decided per column: **§12.8 MUST state that a binding
applies only where every filter it declares is satisfied**, and the
`trail` MUST say which filter excluded a binding that did not fire. A
cascade that cannot explain an absence is the failure the first MCP
session actually hit.

## What it breaks

- **Any file already using these columns changes meaning** — from "in
  force everywhere" to "in force where the filter matches". No fixture
  does; a user file might.
- **Removing two columns is a schema bump** and drops whatever was
  written in them.
- **Two published results move if the fixture exercises the new rules**,
  which it should: a rule this proposal adds and the fixture does not
  use is the same invisible defect one revision later.
- **§12.17's variant scoring gains a second caller**, so a change to it
  now changes media resolution as well.

## Alternatives

**Do nothing.** The columns stay, and every one of them is a trap that
looks like a feature. An author uses `time_of_day_filter` because it is
there, gets a night reference in a day scene, and finds out why by
reading the resolver. That is the worst of the options and it is the
current state.

**Remove all six and keep only the scene range.** Honest, smaller, and
defensible: the range can express every case above, awkwardly. It loses
the ability to say *why* a binding is scoped — "because she is injured"
rather than "because scenes 9 to 24" — which is exactly the kind of
authorial intent the rest of the format keeps.

**Specify all six, including `conditions_json`.** Rejected with 0025:
nobody can say what a condition is, and a filter nothing can evaluate is
the problem this proposal is about.

## Resolved in implementation (spec 0.56, schema 2.16)

Both open questions were settled by §12.8.1, and settled the same way:
the trail carries what a finding would have carried.

- **A filter that cannot be satisfied excludes the binding**, and the
  `trail` says which filter did it and what it was compared against —
  `EXCLUDED, time_of_day_filter "night" vs scene "morning"`, or
  `physical_state_filter "wounded", no such physical state in force`.
  The worry behind the question was that excluding loses media
  silently. It is the SILENTLY that was the problem, not the excluding,
  and an explained absence is not silent.

  **No finding is raised**, which is the part that changed from the
  recommendation here. A binding scoped to a state the character is not
  in at this position has not gone wrong — it is a binding doing its
  job. §9's findings are for a file that cannot be read or is not
  finished, and "this condition is false right now" is neither.

  A filter pointing at a row that does not exist — a `variant_id` whose
  variant was deleted — is a different matter, and checking the
  catalog while writing this turned up that **nothing reports it**:
  `junction.endpoint_absent` covers link rows only, and a binding is
  not a link. That is a gap in reference integrity rather than in this
  proposal, it applies to every reference column in the format and not
  just these, and it belongs in its own proposal. Until then such a
  binding simply never applies, and its trail line says the variant is
  not the one in force — true, and not the most useful thing that could
  be said.

- **Filters compose as AND**, as recommended. Every filter a binding
  declares must be satisfied; a filter left null is no condition at
  all. "Any of these" would make a binding weaker for each condition
  its author added, which is the opposite of what writing one means.

One thing this proposal did not anticipate: **with no position asked
about, no positional filter is evaluated at all.** Q13 can be asked
without a scene, and then only baselines apply (§12.8.1) — there is
nothing to evaluate a filter against, and a baseline that declares one
is answering a question nobody asked.
