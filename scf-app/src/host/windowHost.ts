 * windowHost.ts — the desktop app's host, run in its own window.

 * In the desktop app there is no host process: the window runs the host
 * core (scf-host `core.ts`) on the shell's files and SQLite
 * (`tauriPlatform.ts`), and its client talks to it in-process. Every
 * film still has one owner, the core, and every client goes through it,
 * so nothing in docs/scf-write-ownership.md changes except where the
 * owner lives.
 *
 * The core is started once, by the first connect, and lives as long as
 * the page. What it is given (roots, where snapshots and the journal go,
 * the version it reports) comes from the shell (`host_setup` in
 * `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`).
