artifact_manifest.py — record the published artifacts, with checksums,
and the tag each one is addressed by.

The registry, the physical DDL and the fixture need to be fetchable BY
VERSION and verifiable once fetched. The obvious way to do that is to
commit a copy per version, and that is the wrong way: registry.json is
400KB and would be duplicated on every bump, immediately raising the
question of which copy is real.

Git already versions files. What was missing is an addressing scheme and
a way to check that what you downloaded is what was published. So:

  - a tag pins the tree,
  - the raw URL at that tag is the artifact's address,
  - this manifest carries the SHA-256 so a consumer can verify it.

There are two tags, because there are two versions (spec §11.5 and
conventions §8). `schema-X.Y` addresses what cannot change without a
SCHEMA_VERSION bump: the registry and what is generated from it alone.
`spec-X.Y` addresses everything else — the prose, the blessed results,
the fixture — which changes with every specification release, schema
change or not. A schema tag that addressed the prose would have to move
whenever the prose did, and a pin that moves is not a pin.

    python3 schema/artifact_manifest.py            # write
    python3 schema/artifact_manifest.py --check    # verify, for CI

--check fails if any artifact's hash has moved without the manifest
being regenerated, which is the same guarantee the registry generator
gives, applied to publication rather than generation.
