/**
 * queryTools.ts — one MCP tool per canonical query, precisely typed.
 *
 * Originally these sixteen went through a single generic `query(id,
 * params)` tool with a loose `Record<string, string>` schema. In use,
 * an agent given that shape had no way to know which params a given id
 * needed short of guessing or reading source — the same discoverability
 * failure `list` was built to fix for enumeration, here for parameters.
 *
 * The fix leans on something that already existed and was already
 * authoritative: every query's name, one-line purpose and exact
 * parameter names are published in spec/scf-spec.md §12 (Q00 §12.12
 * through Q15 §12.14) — copied here as data, not re-derived, so this
 * catalog can't say something the spec doesn't. Each entry becomes one
 * `registerTool` call with a Zod shape naming exactly the params
 * dispatch.ts's `buildDispatch` already expects, so a wrong or missing
 * parameter is rejected by schema validation before it reaches the
 * server at all, not discovered by a failed call.
 *
 * "Copied here as data" is checked, not trusted: id/title/section/
 * summary are the same facts spec/query-reference.md already generates
 * (scf-core/scripts/emit_query_reference.mjs) and CI already keeps
 * honest against §12 (`check-query-reference`). Without a second check
 * tying THIS copy to that one, CATALOG could retitle a query or drop a
 * param and nothing would notice — see
 * test/queryCatalog.consistency.test.ts, which fails the build if the
 * two ever disagree.
 *
 * Each tool is registered under a semantic name derived from its title
 * (`toolNameFor`, e.g. "Voice direction" -> "voice_direction") rather
 * than the bare id: a tool named "Q05" tells an agent skimming
 * `tools/list` nothing, where "voice_direction" does. The id stays in
 * the description (spec cross-reference) and in every result's own
 * `query` envelope field (spec §12.1.1) — nothing about the id is lost,
 * it just isn't what selects the tool anymore.
 *
 * Q14 is deliberately not here — the friendlier, separately-named
 * `readiness` tool in server.ts already is Q14, and a "Q14" tool
 * alongside it would be the same capability under two names.
